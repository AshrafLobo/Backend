Further to the public announcement made on 10th May 2021 the Board of Directors of WPP Scangroup PLC wishes to inform its shareholders and the public that the audited financial statements for the financial year ended 31st December 2020 are expected to be published on 31st July 2021. The delay in publication of the audited financial statements has been occasioned by the ongoing investigation that followed the recent senior management changes previously notified to shareholders and the public. The Board of Directors, management and the Company's auditors are working to ensure that shareholders and investors are provided with audited financial statements that reflect the impact (if any) of these developments on the Company's financial position.
